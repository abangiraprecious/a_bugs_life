 3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users. 
 4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

 4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end. 
 5. Opening tags carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
