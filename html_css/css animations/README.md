# CSS Animations Practice
Heya! Welcome to my CSS Animations practice repository! This is a collection of basic CSS animation examples and exercises that I'm working on to improve my understanding and skills with CSS animations. The goal is to familiarize myself with the properties and methods used to create smooth animations on web pages. I started with basic animations like simple fades, hover effects, and basic transformations such as scaling and rotating elements. These examples will help me get comfortable with the core animation properties like @keyframes, transition, and transform. As I progress, I went into more complex animations, including multi-step keyframe sequences, 3D transformations, and interactive animations that respond to user actions like hover, click, and scroll. Each file in this project demonstrates a different kind of animation, ranging from basic transitions to more advanced effects like rotating elements, bouncing, or fading.

## CSS Animation Learning Path

1. **Basic Transitions (Beginner Level)**
   - `transition`
   - `transition-property`
   - `transition-duration`
   - `transition-timing-function`
   - `transition-delay`

2. **Keyframe Animations (Intermediate Level)**
   - `@keyframes`
   - `animation`
   - `animation-name`
   - `animation-duration`
   - `animation-timing-function`
   - `animation-delay`
   - `animation-iteration-count`
   - `animation-direction`
   - `animation-fill-mode`

3. **Transformations (Intermediate Level)**
   - `transform`
   - `transform-origin`
   - `scale()`
   - `rotate()`
   - `translate()`
   - `skew()`

4. **Timing Functions (Intermediate to Advanced)**
   - `ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`
   - Custom cubic-bezier timing functions (`cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)`)
   - `steps()`

5. **Advanced Keyframe Animations (Advanced Level)**
   - Multi-step Keyframe Animations
   - Combined Animations (e.g., `transform`, `opacity`, `color`, `box-shadow`)

6. **3D Transformations and Perspective (Advanced Level)**
   - `perspective`
   - `transform-style`
   - `rotateX()`, `rotateY()`, `rotateZ()`
   - `translateZ()`
   - `matrix3d()`

7. **Animations on Scroll and User Interaction (Advanced Level)**
   - `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, `:checked` pseudo-classes
   - Scroll-triggered animations (with JavaScript or CSS `position: sticky`)
   - CSS Scroll Snap

8. **Advanced CSS Animation Techniques (Expert Level)**
   - CSS Animation with `clip-path`
   - SVG Animations (e.g., `stroke-dasharray`, `stroke-dashoffset`)
   - Text Animations
   - Custom Cursor Animations
   - Physics-based Animations

9. **Performance Optimization for CSS Animations (Expert Level)**
   - GPU Acceleration (`transform`, `opacity` for smoother animations)
   - Avoiding layout and paint recalculations
   - `will-change` property
